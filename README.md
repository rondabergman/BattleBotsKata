# 🧩 Battle Bots Arena Kata

Welcome to the Battle Bots Arena! This kata is designed for mid-level C# developers to practice implementing the **Strategy** and **Decorator** design patterns while pair programming.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Implement Strategy and Decorator patterns in C#
- Refactor code for flexibility and maintainability
- Practice pair programming styles (driver/navigator, ping-pong)

## 🕹️ Scenario

You're building a battle simulator where bots fight using different attack strategies and optional enhancements.

### Requirements

- Bots have a name and health
- Bots attack using different strategies (melee, ranged, magic)
- Bots can be enhanced with decorators (shield, poison, speed boost)

## 🧪 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code
3. Run the tests to verify setup
4. Start pair programming using ping-pong style:
   - One writes a test, the other writes code to pass it

## 🧱 Suggested Extensions

- Add combo decorators (e.g., Shield + Poison)
- Implement logging decorators
- Add unit tests for edge cases

## 🤝 Pairing Tips

- Switch roles every 10–15 minutes
- Use TDD to guide implementation
- Reflect on where these patterns apply in your own codebase

Happy coding!
